# B(E)ACON
Will be a very flat tracker that combines an nRF7000, an nRF54L15, and an IMU into a fully passive device, no GPS is used. BLE is activated only when transmitting recorded data and specific conditions are met. The unit also features self‑destruct capabilities triggered by the IMU.

For ease of use it will include the necessary power‑management circuitry to charge the special flat batteries, and the entire assembly will fit into a compact package measuring roughly 15 × 70 × 3 mm. Waterproofing will be achieved with a conformal coating, and the device can be concealed using hockey tape.
